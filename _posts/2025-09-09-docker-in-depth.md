## üîç What is Docker? (Short & Sweet)

Docker is a platform that packages an application and its dependencies into a **container** ‚Äî a lightweight, portable, and self-contained runtime. Containers share the host OS kernel but are isolated (process, filesystem, network), making them fast to start and consistent across environments.

Benefits at a glance:

* Portability (dev ‚Üí QA ‚Üí prod)
* Fast startup and low overhead vs VMs
* Reproducibility and easier CI/CD
* Great for microservices, local dev, testing

## üß© Core Concepts & Components

### 1. **Image**

A read-only template (layers) used to create containers. Built from a `Dockerfile`. Images are immutable and layered (copy-on-write).

### 2. **Container**

A running instance of an image ‚Äî isolated process(s) with its own namespace, filesystem view, and resource limits.

### 3. **Dockerfile**

A text file with instructions to build an image (e.g., `FROM`, `COPY`, `RUN`, `CMD`).

### 4. **Docker Engine / Daemon (`dockerd`)**

The background service that builds, runs, and manages containers.

### 5. **Docker CLI (`docker`)**

Client tool to interact with the daemon (build, run, push, etc).

### 6. **Registry**

A service to store/retrieve images (Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, private registry).

### 7. **Volumes**

Persistent storage for containers. Keeps data outside the writable container layer.

### 8. **Networks**

Connect containers; Docker provides bridge, host, overlay networks.

### 9. **Compose**

`docker-compose` defines and runs multi-container apps (local orchestration).

### 10. **Orchestration**

For production scaling: Docker Swarm, Kubernetes. These manage scheduling, scaling, service discovery, rolling updates.

### 11. **Under the hood**

* **Namespaces** ‚Üí isolation (PID, mount, network, UTS, IPC, user).
* **cgroups** ‚Üí resource limits (CPU, memory, IO).
* **Union file systems** (overlayfs) ‚Üí layered images, copy-on-write.
* **runc / containerd** ‚Üí lower-level runtime components.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Docker Works (Stepwise)

1. **Write a Dockerfile**: describes how to assemble an image.
2. **`docker build`**: daemon executes instructions, producing an image (layers cached).
3. **Image stored** locally as layered filesystem. Tag it.
4. **`docker run`**: daemon creates a container from the image, sets up namespaces & cgroups, mounts the filesystem, and starts the process.
5. **Networking** created (bridge by default). Ports mapped to host if requested.
6. **Volume mount** if persistence needed.
7. **Push** images to a registry; other hosts `docker pull` and `docker run`.
8. **Orchestrator** schedules containers across nodes, handles scaling & health.

## üõ† Step-by-Step: Move Your App to Docker (Practical Example)

We'll containerize a simple Node.js app (the same steps work for Rails, Python, Java, etc).

### Project structure

```
my-app/
‚îú‚îÄ package.json
‚îú‚îÄ index.js
‚îú‚îÄ .dockerignore
```

### 1) Add `.dockerignore`

```
node_modules
npm-debug.log
.git
```

### 2) Dockerfile (simple + recommended multistage)

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: build
FROM node:18 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build   # if you have a build step

# Stage 2: runtime - smaller image
FROM node:18-slim
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV=production
# Create non-root user
RUN useradd --user-group --create-home --shell /bin/false appuser
COPY --from=build /app ./
RUN chown -R appuser:appuser /app
USER appuser
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

**Why multistage?** Keeps final image small and avoids shipping build tools.

### 3) Build the image locally

```bash
docker build -t yourusername/my-app:1.0.0 .
```

### 4) Run locally (development)

```bash
# map port, mount source for live edit
docker run --rm -it -p 3000:3000 -v "$(pwd)":/app yourusername/my-app:1.0.0
```

### 5) Compose for multi-service (app + db)

`docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
      - DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@db:5432/mydb
    depends_on:
      - db
    volumes:
      - .:/app
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: mydb
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
volumes:
  pgdata:
```

Start:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### 6) Tag & push to registry

```bash
docker login
docker tag yourusername/my-app:1.0.0 ghcr.io/yourusername/my-app:1.0.0   # or dockerhub
docker push ghcr.io/yourusername/my-app:1.0.0
```

### 7) Deploy to a server

On the server:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/yourusername/my-app:1.0.0
docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped -p 80:3000 \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e DATABASE_URL=... \
  --name my-app \
  ghcr.io/yourusername/my-app:1.0.0
```

### 8) Production considerations

* Instead of `docker run`, use an orchestrator (Kubernetes, ECS, or Docker Swarm).
* Use environment variables and secrets (do **not** store secrets in images).
* Use health checks (`HEALTHCHECK` in Dockerfile or readiness probe in k8s).
* Logging: stdout/stderr (centralize with ELK, Grafana Loki, etc).

## ‚úÖ Docker Use Cases & Features

### Use cases

* Microservices architecture
* CI/CD pipelines (build/test images per commit)
* Local dev environments mirroring production
* Reproducible testing environments
* Resource-efficient multi-tenant workloads
* Edge and serverless containers
* Packaging legacy apps to standardize runtime

### Notable features

* Image layering & caching for fast builds
* Multi-stage builds to reduce final image size
* Named volumes for persistent data
* Network models: bridge/overlay/host
* Service discovery (via Docker Swarm or external)
* Compose for local dev orchestration
* Integration with registries, CI (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)
* Security scanning & signing (with tools like trivy, cosign)

---

## üß≠ Best Practices (Do These)

* Use small base images (e.g., `alpine`, `slim`) when appropriate.
* Use **multistage builds** to keep images minimal.
* Add `.dockerignore` to avoid copying unnecessary files (speeds build).
* Pin base image versions (`node:18.16.0-slim`) to avoid surprises.
* Run processes as **non-root** inside containers.
* Set resource limits (`--memory`, `--cpus`) for production containers.
* Use environment variables for config; use secrets stores for credentials.
* Use health checks: `HEALTHCHECK CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1`
* Scan images regularly (Trivy, Clair).
* Keep images ephemeral; store data in volumes or external services.
* Use immutable tags (release `v1.2.3`) along with `latest` for development.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Tips

* Minimize the attack surface: fewer packages, smaller images.
* Use official or trusted base images.
* Regularly update and rebuild images for OS/security patches.
* Avoid embedding secrets in images or source.
* Run containers with least privileges (`--cap-drop ALL`, read-only filesystem).
* Scan images and sign trusted images for provenance.

---

## üîß Troubleshooting ‚Äî Quick Tips

* Container exits immediately: check `docker logs <container>` and `docker ps -a`.
* Port conflict: ensure host port not already in use.
* Permission error on volumes: fix ownership/uid mapping or use named volumes.
* Slow builds: leverage caching (ordering of Dockerfile), use specific `.dockerignore`.
* Large image size: inspect layers (`docker history`) and use multistage.

## üìú Useful Commands Cheat-Sheet

```bash
# Build & run
docker build -t myapp:latest .
docker run --rm -it -p 3000:3000 myapp:latest

# List & logs
docker ps
docker ps -a
docker logs -f <container>

# Images & cleanup
docker images
docker rmi <image>
docker system prune -a    # remove unused objects

# Compose
docker-compose up --build -d
docker-compose down

# Save/pull/push
docker tag myapp:latest registry.example.com/myorg/myapp:1.0.0
docker push registry.example.com/myorg/myapp:1.0.0
docker pull registry.example.com/myorg/myapp:1.0.0
```

---

## üîÅ From Local Docker to Kubernetes (high level)

1. Push images to a registry.
2. Create k8s manifests: `Deployment`, `Service`, `ConfigMap`, `Secret`, `PersistentVolumeClaim`.
3. Use `kubectl apply -f` to deploy.
4. Use `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` for scaling; `Ingress` for routing.
5. Monitor with Prometheus + Grafana and manage lifecycle via Helm charts.

## üéØ Final Notes & Checklist Before You Ship

* [ ] Image builds reproducible and small
* [ ] No secrets baked into images
* [ ] Non-root process in container
* [ ] Health checks + logs forwarded to aggregator
* [ ] Proper resource requests/limits (or runtime limits)
* [ ] CI builds image and pushes to registry
* [ ] Deployment uses immutable tags and supports rollback
