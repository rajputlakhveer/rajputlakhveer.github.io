## 1️⃣ `ViewComponent` – 📦 Build Reusable UI Components Like a Pro

* Increases maintainability

**Example:**

```ruby
# app/components/button_component.rb
class ButtonComponent < ViewComponent::Base
  def initialize(text:)
    @text = text
  end
end

# app/components/button_component.html.erb
<button class="btn btn-primary"><%= @text %></button>

# Usage in views
<%= render ButtonComponent.new(text: "Click Me!") %>
```

🎯 *Perfect for teams building large applications with shared UI elements!*
