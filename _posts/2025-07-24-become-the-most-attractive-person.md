## 🔑 Principle 1: Self-Concept = Self-Identity

> *"You become what you believe."* — Oprah Winfrey

**Psychology Insight**: The **Self-Concept Theory** by Carl Rogers suggests that we behave in ways that are consistent with our self-image.

**Example**: If you constantly think, *"I'm awkward and shy,"* you’ll behave in awkward ways. But if you train your brain to say, *"I’m confident and grounded,"* your behavior starts shifting automatically.

**🔥 Tip**:
🔹 Write 3 affirmations about your ideal self.
🔹 Repeat them **daily in the mirror** with emotion.
🔹 Visualize living as that version.

## 🧘 Principle 3: Dopamine Discipline = Magnetic Energy

**🔥 Tip**:
🚫 Avoid digital dopamine early morning.
📅 Use **dopamine detox** every Sunday.
🏆 Replace short-term hits with long-term achievements (gym, reading, skill learning).

> *"Your body language shapes who you are."* — Amy Cuddy (Harvard Psychologist)
