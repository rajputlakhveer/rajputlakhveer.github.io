## **üí° The Truth About Money: Why It‚Äôs Not Evil (But Poverty Is)**  

### **The Misunderstood Bible Verse**  
Many quote *"Money is the root of all evil"*‚Äîbut the actual scripture (1 Timothy 6:10) says:  
*"For the **love** of money is a root of all kinds of evil."*  

**Key distinction:** Obsession over money is destructive, but money itself is neutral‚Äîlike fire. Used wisely, it warms homes; uncontrolled, it burns them down.  

### **The Moral Neutrality of Wealth**  
Wealth magnifies character:  
- **Warren Buffett** pledged 99% of his fortune to philanthropy.  
- **Scammers** use money to exploit others.  
The difference? **Values**, not dollars.  

### **The Psychology of Scarcity vs. Abundance**  
Poverty mindset:  
- *"There‚Äôs never enough."* ‚Üí Hoards resources, fears risk.  
Wealth mindset:  
- *"Opportunities are infinite."* ‚Üí Invests, collaborates, creates.  

**Stanford study:** Low-income individuals forced to make financial decisions showed **13-point IQ drops** due to stress‚Äîproving poverty consumes mental bandwidth.
