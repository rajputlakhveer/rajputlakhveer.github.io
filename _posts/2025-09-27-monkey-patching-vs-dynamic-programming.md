# 🐒 Monkey Patching vs ⚡ Dynamic Programming: Two Powerful Coding Techniques Explained!

In the world of programming, developers often stumble upon unique concepts that can completely change how they think about code. Two such concepts are **Monkey Patching** and **Dynamic Programming (DP)**.

Although they sound unrelated—one is a *runtime modification trick*, while the other is a *problem-solving strategy*—both are incredibly powerful when used correctly. 🚀

Let’s dive deep into what they are, how they work, and some **pro tips** to code like a true professional. 💡

## 🐵 Monkey Patching: Changing the Code on the Fly

Monkey Patching refers to **modifying or extending a class or module at runtime**, without altering the original source code.
It’s like sneaking into someone’s house and rearranging the furniture while they’re still inside! 😅

### 🔑 Key Features

* ✏️ **Runtime Modifications** – Change existing methods or add new ones without touching the original file.
* 🔄 **Quick Fixes** – Useful for patching bugs in third-party libraries.
* 🧪 **Testing Helper** – Helps in mocking methods during testing.

### 💡 Example in Ruby

```ruby
# Original class
class String
  def shout
    self.upcase
  end
end

puts "hello".shout  # Output: HELLO

# Monkey Patch to modify behavior
class String
  def shout
    "👉 #{self.upcase} 👈"
  end
end

puts "hello".shout  # Output: 👉 HELLO 👈
```

💥 **Trick:**
You can even override core Ruby methods like `Array#sum` or `Time#now`, but use it carefully as it might break other parts of your app.

### ⚠️ Caution

* ❌ **Risky in Production** – Can cause unexpected side effects.
* ❌ **Hard to Debug** – Changes are not obvious in the original codebase.

💎 **Pro Tip:**
If you must patch, clearly document it and use **refinements** or **modules** in Ruby to keep it scoped.

## ⚡ Dynamic Programming: Optimize Your Algorithm

Dynamic Programming (DP) is an **algorithmic technique** used to solve problems by breaking them down into **overlapping subproblems** and storing their solutions to avoid redundant calculations.

Think of it as a smart way to avoid **recomputing the same thing again and again**. 💡

### 🔑 Key Features

* 💾 **Memoization** – Store results of subproblems for quick lookup.
* 🔄 **Tabulation** – Solve from the bottom up using tables/arrays.
* ⚡ **Efficiency** – Reduces time complexity drastically.

### 💡 Example: Fibonacci Sequence

The naive way to calculate the nth Fibonacci number is slow because it recalculates the same subproblems.

#### ❌ Naive Recursion

```ruby
def fib(n)
  return n if n <= 1
  fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
end
puts fib(10) # Slow for large n
```

#### ✅ Dynamic Programming with Memoization

```ruby
def fib(n, memo = {})
  return n if n <= 1
  memo[n] ||= fib(n-1, memo) + fib(n-2, memo)
end

puts fib(50) # Blazing fast! ⚡
```

💥 **Trick:**
DP can be used in **pathfinding (like Dijkstra)**, **knapsack problems**, **game theory**, and even **AI algorithms**.

## 🥊 Monkey Patching vs Dynamic Programming: Key Difference

| Feature      | 🐵 Monkey Patching               | ⚡ Dynamic Programming           |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**  | Modify code behavior at runtime  | Optimize algorithm performance  |
| **Use Case** | Quick fixes, extending libraries | Solving overlapping subproblems |
| **Risk**     | High (unintended side effects)   | Low (logical and safe)          |
| **Example**  | Adding method to `String`        | Memoizing Fibonacci             |

💎 **In Short**:

* Monkey Patching 👉 *Code modification technique*
* Dynamic Programming 👉 *Problem-solving technique*

## 💡 Pro Tips to Code Like a Pro

Whether you’re monkey patching or writing DP algorithms, these tips will make you stand out as a professional developer:

1. **Comment Your Patches 📝** – Always document runtime changes for future maintainers.
2. **Prefer Modules & Refinements 🔒** – In Ruby, use `refinements` instead of direct monkey patching for safer overrides.
3. **Practice DP Patterns 🧩** – Master common DP problems like *Longest Common Subsequence* or *Matrix Chain Multiplication*.
4. **Write Tests ✅** – For monkey patches, tests ensure nothing breaks silently.
5. **Optimize Space Complexity 💽** – Many DP solutions can be optimized from O(n) space to O(1).
6. **Profile Your Code 🔍** – Use tools like `Benchmark` in Ruby to identify performance bottlenecks.

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

Both **Monkey Patching** and **Dynamic Programming** are like *superpowers* in your developer toolkit.

* Use 🐒 Monkey Patching when you need flexibility and quick fixes.
* Use ⚡ Dynamic Programming when solving tough computational problems.

But remember—**with great power comes great responsibility.** 😉
Use them wisely, write clean code, and you’ll be coding like a pro in no time! 💎
