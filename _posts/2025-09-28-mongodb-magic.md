## 🌟 **What is MongoDB?**

MongoDB is an **open-source NoSQL database** that stores data in **JSON-like documents** instead of traditional rows and columns.

* 📦 **Data Format**: BSON (Binary JSON)
* 🌍 **Flexibility**: Schema-less design (no rigid table structure!)
* ⚡ **Performance**: Designed for high-speed data operations

Example of a MongoDB document:

```json
{
  "name": "Lakhveer",
  "role": "Full Stack Developer",
  "skills": ["Ruby on Rails", "Python", "ReactJS"],
  "experience": 3
}
```

💡 **Why it’s cool:** You can add new fields anytime without changing the schema!

---

## 🔑 **Key Features of MongoDB** (With Examples)

### 1️⃣ **Document-Oriented Storage** 🗂️

Instead of rows & columns, MongoDB stores data as **documents** (BSON format).
✅ **Example Query:**

```javascript
db.users.insertOne({
  name: "Alice",
  age: 28,
  hobbies: ["coding", "traveling"]
});
```

👉 Flexible structure lets you evolve data models on the go.

---

### 2️⃣ **Schema-less Database** 🛠️

No need to define strict schemas like SQL. Each document can have **different fields**.
✅ You can store:

```javascript
{ name: "Bob", age: 30 }
{ name: "Charlie", city: "Delhi", skills: ["JS", "Ruby"] }
```

🔥 **Hack:** Start quickly without worrying about migrations!

---

### 3️⃣ **High Performance with Indexing** ⚡

Indexes speed up query operations.
✅ **Example:**

```javascript
db.users.createIndex({ name: 1 });
```

⚡ Queries like `db.users.find({ name: "Alice" })` become blazingly fast.

---

### 4️⃣ **Horizontal Scaling with Sharding** 🌍

Sharding distributes large datasets across multiple machines.
💡 Perfect for **Big Data** applications like e-commerce platforms.

---

### 5️⃣ **Replication for High Availability** 🔁

MongoDB supports **replica sets**, ensuring your data stays available even if a server goes down.
✅ **Setup Example:**

* **Primary Node:** Handles all writes
* **Secondary Nodes:** Sync data and handle failovers automatically.

---

### 6️⃣ **Powerful Query Language** 🔎

MongoDB’s query language supports **filtering, sorting, and aggregation**.
✅ Example:

```javascript
db.orders.find({ amount: { $gt: 500 } }).sort({ amount: -1 });
```

💡 Filter large datasets in milliseconds!

---

### 7️⃣ **Aggregation Framework** 🔥

Perform **real-time analytics** with complex data pipelines.
✅ Example:

```javascript
db.sales.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "completed" } },
  { $group: { _id: "$product", totalSales: { $sum: "$amount" } } }
]);
```

🎯 Great for dashboards and reports!

---

### 8️⃣ **Geospatial Queries** 🗺️

Handle location-based data with ease.
✅ Example:

```javascript
db.places.find({
  location: {
    $near: { $geometry: { type: "Point", coordinates: [77.5946, 12.9716] }, $maxDistance: 5000 }
  }
});
```

🚴 Perfect for **ride-sharing**, **food delivery**, or **travel apps**.

## 🧩 **MongoDB Tricks & Hacks to Code Like a Pro** ⚡

💡 **1. Use Projections for Speed**
Fetch only required fields to improve performance:

```javascript
db.users.find({}, { name: 1, age: 1, _id: 0 });
```

💡 **2. Bulk Operations**
Insert or update multiple records in one go:

```javascript
db.users.insertMany([{name:"Tom"}, {name:"Jerry"}]);
```

💡 **3. TTL Collections (Time-To-Live)** ⏳
Auto-delete old records (great for logs or sessions):

```javascript
db.sessions.createIndex({ createdAt: 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 3600 });
```

💡 **4. Upserts** (Update or Insert)
Update a document if it exists; otherwise, create it:

```javascript
db.users.updateOne(
  { name: "Alice" },
  { $set: { age: 29 } },
  { upsert: true }
);
```

💡 **5. Aggregation with `$lookup`** (Joins)
Join two collections:

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "customers",
      localField: "customerId",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "customerInfo"
    }
  }
]);
```

💡 **6. Hidden Gems**

* `$text` → Full-text search
* `$regex` → Pattern matching
* `$sample` → Random document selection
