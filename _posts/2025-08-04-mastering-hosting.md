## 🧠 What is Hosting?

Simply put, **Hosting** means storing your website’s files (HTML, CSS, media, databases) on a **server** that is accessible 24/7 via the internet. 🌍

So when someone types *[www.yoursite.com](http://www.yoursite.com)* ➡️ the request goes to a **host server** ➡️ which returns the content to the user's browser in seconds.
