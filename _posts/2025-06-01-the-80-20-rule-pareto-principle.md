## **10 Powerful Ways to Apply the 80-20 Rule (With Examples) 🎯**  

### **1. Focus on High-Impact Tasks First**  
Most people waste time on **busywork** instead of **impact work**.

📌 *Example:* A writer’s 20% is **writing the draft**—not endless research or formatting.*  

### **2. Fire the 80% of Clients Who Drain You**

You don’t need 10 supplements—just **sleep, hydration, and compound lifts**.

You don’t need 500 friends—just **a few deep connections**.
