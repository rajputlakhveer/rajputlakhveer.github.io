## 1️⃣ Multiple Variable Assignment in One Line ✍️

Instead of writing several lines, Python allows assigning multiple variables in one shot.

```python
# Normal way
a = 10
b = 20
c = 30

# Pythonic way
a, b, c = 10, 20, 30
print(a, b, c)  # Output: 10 20 30
```

✅ Cleaner, shorter, and great for readability.

---

## 2️⃣ Swapping Variables Without Temporary Variable 🔄

Forget the old-school `temp` variable trick!

```python
x, y = 5, 10
x, y = y, x
print(x, y)  # Output: 10 5
```

👉 This is one of the simplest yet most loved Python tricks.

---

## 3️⃣ Using `enumerate()` Instead of Range + Index 📊

When looping through lists, `enumerate()` saves effort.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Without enumerate
for i in range(len(fruits)):
    print(i, fruits[i])

# With enumerate
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(index, fruit)
```

🎯 Much cleaner and more Pythonic.

## 4️⃣ List Comprehensions: Write Short & Clean Loops ✨

Instead of writing multiple lines for loops, use **list comprehensions**.

```python
# Normal loop
squares = []
for i in range(1, 6):
    squares.append(i * i)

# List comprehension
squares = [i * i for i in range(1, 6)]
print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

🔥 Bonus: You can even add conditions inside comprehensions.

```python
even_squares = [i*i for i in range(1, 11) if i % 2 == 0]
print(even_squares)  # [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
```

---

## 5️⃣ Dictionary Comprehensions 🗂️

Same as lists, but for dictionaries.

```python
# Normal way
squares = {}
for i in range(1, 6):
    squares[i] = i * i

# Dictionary comprehension
squares = {i: i * i for i in range(1, 6)}
print(squares)  # {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
```

---

## 6️⃣ Using `zip()` to Combine Lists 🤝

Want to pair two lists together? Use `zip()`.

```python
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
scores = [85, 90, 95]

for name, score in zip(names, scores):
    print(f"{name} scored {score}")
```

Output:

```
Alice scored 85
Bob scored 90
Charlie scored 95
```

📌 Super useful in data processing tasks.

## 7️⃣ Unpacking with `*` and `**` ⭐

Python allows you to unpack lists/tuples easily.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(*numbers)  
# Output: 1 2 3 4 5
```

You can also unpack dictionaries in functions:

```python
def greet(name, age):
    print(f"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old.")

person = {"name": "John", "age": 25}
greet(**person)
# Output: Hello John, you are 25 years old.
```

---

## 8️⃣ Using `any()` and `all()` for Quick Checks ✅

Instead of writing loops, use these built-ins.

```python
nums = [2, 4, 6, 8]

print(all(n % 2 == 0 for n in nums))  # True
print(any(n > 7 for n in nums))      # True
```

💡 `all()` = All conditions true
💡 `any()` = At least one condition true

---

## 9️⃣ The Power of `collections.Counter` 🔢

Count items in a list in seconds.

```python
from collections import Counter

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "apple"]
count = Counter(fruits)

print(count)
# Output: Counter({'apple': 3, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 1})
```

🎯 Great for frequency analysis tasks.

---

## 🔟 Using `f-strings` for Cleaner Formatting 📝

No need to mess with `+` or `.format()`.

```python
name = "Lakhveer"
age = 25

print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
```

✨ Short, powerful, and readable.

# 🎁 Bonus Pro Tips for Python Coders 🚀

✅ Use **virtual environments** (`venv`, `pipenv`, or `poetry`) to manage dependencies.
✅ Apply **type hints** (`def func(x: int) -> str`) for cleaner and safer code.
✅ Learn **decorators** for reusable code functionality.
✅ Use **`with` context managers** for safe file handling.
✅ Master **generators** for memory-efficient coding.
