## **ðŸ”Ÿ Essential SQL Functions for Long Queries**  

Here are **10 powerful functions** (available in major databases) that can simplify complex queries:  

### **1. Window Functions (OVER, PARTITION BY) â€“ PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle**  
ðŸ“Œ **Use Case:** Calculate running totals, rankings, or moving averages.  
```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id, 
    salary, 
    AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) AS avg_dept_salary
FROM employees;
```

### **2. Common Table Expressions (CTEs) â€“ PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MySQL (8.0+), Oracle**  
ðŸ“Œ **Use Case:** Break complex queries into readable chunks.  
```sql
WITH high_earners AS (
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 100000
)
SELECT * FROM high_earners WHERE department = 'Engineering';
```

### **3. STRING_AGG / GROUP_CONCAT â€“ PostgreSQL (STRING_AGG), MySQL (GROUP_CONCAT)**  
ðŸ“Œ **Use Case:** Concatenate strings from multiple rows.  
```sql
-- PostgreSQL
SELECT department_id, STRING_AGG(name, ', ') AS employees 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department_id;

-- MySQL
SELECT department_id, GROUP_CONCAT(name SEPARATOR ', ') AS employees 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department_id;
```

### **4. PIVOT / CROSSTAB â€“ SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL (crosstab)**  
ðŸ“Œ **Use Case:** Transform rows into columns for reports.  
```sql
-- SQL Server
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT year, product, sales FROM sales_data
) AS src
PIVOT (SUM(sales) FOR product IN ([Laptop], [Phone], [Tablet])) AS pvt;
```

### **5. COALESCE / NULLIF â€“ All Databases**  
ðŸ“Œ **Use Case:** Handle NULL values gracefully.  
```sql
SELECT 
    name, 
    COALESCE(bonus, 0) AS bonus -- Replace NULL with 0
FROM employees;
```

### **6. LAG / LEAD â€“ PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle**  
ðŸ“Œ **Use Case:** Compare current row with previous/next row.  
```sql
SELECT 
    date, 
    revenue, 
    LAG(revenue, 1) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS prev_day_revenue
FROM daily_sales;
```

### **7. JSON Functions â€“ PostgreSQL, MySQL (5.7+), SQL Server (2016+)**  
ðŸ“Œ **Use Case:** Query and manipulate JSON data.  
```sql
-- PostgreSQL
SELECT 
    user_id, 
    json_data->>'email' AS email 
FROM users 
WHERE json_data->>'status' = 'active';
```

### **8. Dynamic SQL (EXECUTE) â€“ SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle**  
ðŸ“Œ **Use Case:** Build queries dynamically for flexibility.  
```sql
-- SQL Server
DECLARE @sql NVARCHAR(MAX) = 'SELECT * FROM ' + @table_name;
EXEC sp_executesql @sql;
```

### **9. FILTER Clause (PostgreSQL)**  
ðŸ“Œ **Use Case:** Apply aggregate functions conditionally.  
```sql
SELECT 
    department_id,
    AVG(salary) FILTER (WHERE tenure > 5) AS avg_senior_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

### **10. Recursive CTEs â€“ PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle**  
ðŸ“Œ **Use Case:** Query hierarchical data (org charts, folders).  
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE org_tree AS (
    SELECT id, name, manager_id FROM employees WHERE id = 1 -- CEO
    UNION ALL
    SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id 
    FROM employees e
    JOIN org_tree ot ON e.manager_id = ot.id
)
SELECT * FROM org_tree;
```

## **ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips for Writing Long SQL Queries Efficiently**  

âœ… **Use CTEs for Readability** â€“ Break down complex logic into named blocks.  
âœ… **Format Consistently** â€“ Indent, align, and comment for clarity.  
âœ… **Optimize Joins** â€“ Use `EXPLAIN` to check query performance.  
âœ… **Avoid SELECT *** â€“ Fetch only necessary columns.  
âœ… **Index Strategically** â€“ Ensure joins and WHERE clauses use indexes.  
âœ… **Test Incrementally** â€“ Build your query step-by-step.  
âœ… **Use Temporary Tables** â€“ For extremely complex queries, stage intermediate results.
