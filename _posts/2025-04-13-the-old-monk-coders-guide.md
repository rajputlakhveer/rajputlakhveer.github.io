# 🧙‍♂️ **The Old Monk Coder’s Guide: Timeless Methods & Principles for Zen-Like Programming** 🏯  

*"The wise programmer writes code that lasts, not just code that works."*  

In the fast-paced world of coding, it’s easy to get lost in trends, hacks, and quick fixes. But the **true masters**—the **Old Monk Coders**—know that real wisdom lies in **timeless methods and principles**. These practices make your code **clean, maintainable, and almost magical** ✨.  

![2_02G01150](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff8ef55c-d4c3-44e7-aa9f-4c9184ab997b)

Let’s channel our inner coding monks and explore the sacred teachings. 🧘‍♂️  

---

## **1. The Principle of Least Surprise (POLS) 🤔**  
*"Code should do what it says, and say what it does."*  

An Old Monk Coder writes code that behaves **predictably**. If a function is named `calculateTotal()`, it shouldn’t also send an email.  

### **❌ Bad (Surprising Behavior)**  
```python
def save_user_data(user):
    user.save()
    send_welcome_email(user)  # Why is this here?! 😱
```  

### **✅ Good (Expected Behavior)**  
```python
def save_user_data(user):
    user.save()  # Does one thing, does it well. 🎯

def onboard_user(user):
    save_user_data(user)
    send_welcome_email(user)  # Clear separation. 🧘‍♂️
```  

---

## **2. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) 😌**  
*"Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."*  

Old Monk Coders avoid **over-engineering**. The simplest solution is often the best.  

### **❌ Over-Engineered**  
```javascript
function isEven(num) {
    return num % 2 === 0 ? true : false;  # Redundant ternary. 🤦‍♂️
}
```  

### **✅ Simple & Clear**  
```javascript
function isEven(num) {
    return num % 2 === 0;  # Just return the boolean! 🎉
}
```  

---

## **3. DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) 🚿**  
*"Repetition is the enemy of maintainability."*  

If you find yourself copying code, **refactor it into a reusable function or module**.  

### **❌ WET (We Enjoy Typing) Code**  
```python
def calculate_area_square(side):
    return side * side

def calculate_area_rectangle(length, width):
    return length * width

def calculate_area_circle(radius):
    return 3.14 * radius * radius
```  

### **✅ DRY Code (Using Polymorphism)**  
```python
class Shape:
    def area(self):
        pass

class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self, side):
        self.side = side
    def area(self):
        return self.side * self.side

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius
    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius
```  

---

## **4. YAGNI (You Ain’t Gonna Need It) 🚫**  
*"Do not add functionality until it is necessary."*  

Old Monk Coders **resist the urge** to future-proof everything.  

### **❌ Premature Optimization**  
```java
public class User {
    private String name;
    private String email;
    private String socialSecurityNumber;  // "Might need this later..." 😬
}
```  

### **✅ Just What’s Needed**  
```java
public class User {
    private String name;
    private String email;  // Only what’s required. 🎯
}
```  

---

## **5. The Rule of Three 🔢**  
*"Write it once. Write it twice. Refactor on the third time."*  

Copy-pasting **once** might be okay. **Twice** is a warning. **Three times?** Time to refactor.  

### **❌ Copy-Pasta Hell**  
```javascript
// Login validation (repeated in 3+ places)
if (!email || !password) {
    throw new Error("Missing fields!");
}
```  

### **✅ Extracted into a Function**  
```javascript
function validateInput(fields) {
    for (const field of fields) {
        if (!field.value) {
            throw new Error(`Missing ${field.name}!`);
        }
    }
}

validateInput([{ name: "email", value: email }, { name: "password", value: password }]);
```  

---

## **6. The Boy Scout Rule 🏕️**  
*"Leave the code cleaner than you found it."*  

Every time you touch a file, **improve it slightly**. Fix a typo, rename a variable, or remove a comment.  

### **❌ Messy Code (Before)**  
```python
def get_user(id):  # gets user from db
    return db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", id)
```  

### **✅ Cleaned Up (After)**  
```python
def fetch_user_by_id(user_id: int) -> User:
    """Retrieves a user from the database by their ID."""
    return db.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", user_id)
```  

---

## **Final Wisdom from the Old Monk Coders 🧘‍♂️**  
1. **Write code for humans, not just machines.**  
2. **Debugging is twice as hard as writing code. Write accordingly.**  
3. **The best code is no code at all.** (But when you must write it, make it **beautiful**.)  

Now go forth, young coder, and **code with the wisdom of the ancients**! 🏯✨
