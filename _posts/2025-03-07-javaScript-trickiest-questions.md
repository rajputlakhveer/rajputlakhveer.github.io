## 1. **What’s the Output of `typeof null`? 🤔**

### Question:
```javascript
console.log(typeof null);
```

### Answer:
The output is `"object"`. 😮

### Explanation:
This is a long-standing bug in JavaScript that dates back to its early days. The `typeof` operator incorrectly identifies `null` as an object. To check for `null`, use:
```javascript
console.log(myVar === null); // true if myVar is null
```

---

## 2. **Why Does `0.1 + 0.2 !== 0.3`? 🧮**

### Question:
```javascript
console.log(0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3); // false
```

### Answer:
Due to floating-point precision issues, `0.1 + 0.2` equals `0.30000000000000004`, not `0.3`.

### Explanation:
JavaScript uses binary floating-point arithmetic, which can’t precisely represent decimal fractions. To handle this, use `Number.EPSILON` for comparisons:
```javascript
console.log(Math.abs(0.1 + 0.2 - 0.3) < Number.EPSILON); // true
```

---

## 3. **What’s the Difference Between `==` and `===`? 🤨**

### Question:
```javascript
console.log(1 == "1");  // true
console.log(1 === "1"); // false
```

### Answer:
- `==` performs type coercion, converting values to the same type before comparison.
- `===` checks both value and type without coercion.

### Pro Tip:
Always use `===` to avoid unexpected behavior caused by type coercion. 🛑

---

## 4. **What’s the Output of `[] + []`? 🤯**

### Question:
```javascript
console.log([] + []);
```

### Answer:
The output is an empty string `""`.

### Explanation:
When arrays are used with the `+` operator, they are converted to strings. An empty array becomes an empty string, so `[] + []` results in `""`.

---

## 5. **What’s the Difference Between `let`, `var`, and `const`? 📦**

### Question:
```javascript
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 10;
console.log(y); // ReferenceError
let y = 20;
```

### Answer:
- `var` is function-scoped and hoisted.
- `let` and `const` are block-scoped and not hoisted.
- `const` cannot be reassigned after declaration.

### Pro Tip:
Use `const` by default, `let` for variables that change, and avoid `var`. 🚫

---

## 6. **What’s the Output of `setTimeout` Inside a Loop? ⏳**

### Question:
```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000);
}
```

### Answer:
The output is `3, 3, 3` after 1 second.

### Explanation:
`var` is function-scoped, so by the time the `setTimeout` callback runs, the loop has already completed, and `i` is `3`.

### Fix:
Use `let` for block scoping:
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000);
}
// Output: 0, 1, 2
```

---

## 7. **What’s the Difference Between `null` and `undefined`? ❓**

### Question:
```javascript
console.log(null == undefined);  // true
console.log(null === undefined); // false
```

### Answer:
- `null` is an intentional absence of value.
- `undefined` means a variable has been declared but not assigned.

### Pro Tip:
Use `null` to explicitly indicate "no value" and `undefined` to check if a variable is uninitialized. 🎯

---

## 8. **What’s the Output of `"5" + 3`? 🧐**

### Question:
```javascript
console.log("5" + 3);
```

### Answer:
The output is `"53"`.

### Explanation:
The `+` operator performs string concatenation when one operand is a string. To add numbers, convert the string to a number first:
```javascript
console.log(Number("5") + 3); // 8
```

---

## 9. **What’s the Difference Between `call`, `apply`, and `bind`? 📞**

### Question:
```javascript
const obj = { value: 42 };

function getValue() {
  return this.value;
}

console.log(getValue.call(obj));      // 42
console.log(getValue.apply(obj));     // 42
console.log(getValue.bind(obj)());    // 42
```

### Answer:
- `call` and `apply` invoke the function immediately, with `call` taking arguments individually and `apply` taking them as an array.
- `bind` returns a new function with the context bound.

### Pro Tip:
Use `bind` for partial application or to create reusable functions with a fixed context. 🔗

---

## 10. **What’s the Output of `Promise` Chaining? 🔄**

### Question:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(1)
  .then((x) => x + 1)
  .then((x) => { throw new Error("Error!") })
  .catch(() => 3)
  .then((x) => x + 1)
  .then(console.log);
```

### Answer:
The output is `4`.

### Explanation:
- The first `then` increments `1` to `2`.
- The second `then` throws an error, which is caught by `catch`, returning `3`.
- The final `then` increments `3` to `4`.

## 🚀 Pro Tips for Writing Cleaner JavaScript Code 🧼

1. **Use ES6+ Features**: Embrace `let`, `const`, arrow functions, and destructuring for cleaner code.
2. **Avoid Global Variables**: Use modules and closures to limit scope.
3. **Lint Your Code**: Use tools like ESLint to catch errors and enforce best practices.
4. **Write Pure Functions**: Avoid side effects for predictable and testable code.
5. **Master Asynchronous Programming**: Understand Promises, `async/await`, and event loops.
6. **Optimize Performance**: Use tools like Chrome DevTools to profile and optimize your code.
7. **Read the Docs**: Stay updated with MDN Web Docs and ECMAScript specifications.
