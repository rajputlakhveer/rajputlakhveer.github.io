## 1. **Binary Search üîç**
   - **What it does**: Efficiently finds the position of a target value in a **sorted array**.
   - **How it works**: It repeatedly divides the search interval in half.
   - **Example**: Searching for a word in a dictionary.
   - **Use Case**: Autocomplete features, database indexing.
   - **Code Snippet**:
     ```python
     def binary_search(arr, target):
         left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
         while left <= right:
             mid = (left + right) // 2
             if arr[mid] == target:
                 return mid
             elif arr[mid] < target:
                 left = mid + 1
             else:
                 right = mid - 1
         return -1
     ```

## 2. **Merge Sort üß©**
   - **What it does**: Sorts an array by dividing it into smaller subarrays, sorting them, and merging them back.
   - **How it works**: Uses the **divide-and-conquer** approach.
   - **Example**: Sorting a list of names alphabetically.
   - **Use Case**: External sorting (e.g., sorting large datasets that don‚Äôt fit in memory).
   - **Code Snippet**:
     ```python
     def merge_sort(arr):
         if len(arr) > 1:
             mid = len(arr) // 2
             left = arr[:mid]
             right = arr[mid:]
             merge_sort(left)
             merge_sort(right)
             i = j = k = 0
             while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
                 if left[i] < right[j]:
                     arr[k] = left[i]
                     i += 1
                 else:
                     arr[k] = right[j]
                     j += 1
                 k += 1
             while i < len(left):
                 arr[k] = left[i]
                 i += 1
                 k += 1
             while j < len(right):
                 arr[k] = right[j]
                 j += 1
                 k += 1
     ```

## 3. **Quick Sort ‚ö°**

         if len(arr) <= 1:
             return arr
         pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
         left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
         middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
         right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
         return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)
     ```

         distances[start] = 0
         pq = [(0, start)]
         while pq:
             current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(pq)
             if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
                 continue
             for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
                 distance = current_distance + weight
                 if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                     distances[neighbor] = distance
