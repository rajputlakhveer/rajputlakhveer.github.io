# 🐳 **10 Docker Tips Every Rails Developer Should Know! 🚀**  

Docker is a game-changer for Rails developers, making it easier to manage dependencies, streamline deployments, and ensure consistency across environments. But are you using Docker to its full potential? Here are **10 essential Docker tips** to supercharge your Rails workflow!  

![2023-04-12-docker-what-is-add-command](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6dcf910-5122-40f5-ad61-e577f6931153)

## **1. Use Multi-Stage Builds for Smaller Images 🏗️**  
Large Docker images slow down builds and deployments. Use **multi-stage builds** to keep your final image lean.  

### **Example:**  
```dockerfile
# Build Stage
FROM ruby:3.2 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock ./
RUN bundle install --without development test

# Final Stage
FROM ruby:3.2-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/bundle /usr/local/bundle
COPY . .
CMD ["rails", "server", "-b", "0.0.0.0"]
```  
**Use Case:**  
- Reduces image size by excluding build tools from the final image.  

---

## **2. Leverage Docker Compose for Development 🎭**  
Running Rails with Postgres, Redis, and Sidekiq? **Docker Compose** simplifies multi-container setups.  

### **Example (`docker-compose.yml`):**  
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  redis:
    image: redis:7
  app:
    build: .
    command: rails s -b 0.0.0.0
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis
volumes:
  postgres_data:
```  
**Use Case:**  
- Spin up your entire stack with `docker compose up`—no manual database setup needed!  

---

## **3. Use `.dockerignore` to Speed Up Builds 🚀**  
Avoid copying unnecessary files (like `node_modules` and logs) into your image.  

### **Example (`.dockerignore`):**  
```
.git
node_modules
tmp/*
log/*
.DS_Store
```  
**Use Case:**  
- Faster builds and smaller images.  

---

## **4. Optimize Caching with Layer Ordering 🧠**  
Docker caches layers—order your `COPY` and `RUN` commands wisely!  

### **Example:**  
```dockerfile
COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock ./
RUN bundle install
COPY . .
```  
**Use Case:**  
- If only your app code changes, `bundle install` won’t rerun, saving time.  

---

## **5. Use Volumes for Development Hot-Reloading 🔥**  
Mount your local directory into the container for real-time code changes.  

### **Example (`docker-compose.yml`):**  
```yaml
app:
  volumes:
    - .:/app
```  
**Use Case:**  
- No need to rebuild the container after every change—**instant Rails reloads!**  

---

## **6. Set Up Health Checks for Dependencies 🏥**  
Ensure Postgres/Redis are ready before Rails starts.  

### **Example (`docker-compose.yml`):**  
```yaml
app:
  depends_on:
    db:
      condition: service_healthy
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "pg_isready", "-h", "db"]
    interval: 5s
    timeout: 5s
    retries: 5
```  
**Use Case:**  
- Avoids "database connection failed" errors on startup.  

---

## **7. Use Environment Variables Securely 🔒**  
Store secrets in `.env` (not in the Dockerfile!).  

### **Example (`docker-compose.yml`):**  
```yaml
app:
  env_file:
    - .env
```  
**Use Case:**  
- Keep API keys and DB passwords out of version control.  

---

## **8. Debug Containers with Exec 🐞**  
Need to check logs or run commands inside a container?  

### **Example:**  
```sh
docker exec -it my_rails_app bash
```  
**Use Case:**  
- Debugging, running Rails console (`rails c`), or inspecting logs.  

---

## **9. Clean Up Unused Containers & Images 🧹**  
Free up disk space with:  
```sh
docker system prune -a
```  
**Use Case:**  
- Removes stopped containers, dangling images, and unused networks.  

---

## **10. Use Docker for CI/CD Pipelines ⚡**  
Run tests in an isolated container for consistency.  

### **Example (GitLab CI):**  
```yaml
test:
  image: my_rails_app
  script:
    - bundle exec rspec
```  
**Use Case:**  
- Ensures tests run in the same environment as production.
