## 🧩 The New Core Concepts Every Developer Must Know

1. **AI-Powered Coding** 💻✨
   Tools like **GitHub Copilot**, **Tabnine**, and **Amazon CodeWhisperer** act as AI coding assistants, suggesting lines, auto-completing functions, and even writing full modules based on comments.

2. **ML-Driven Decision Making** 📊
   ML models are increasingly used to make intelligent decisions—whether it's recommending products, detecting fraud, or forecasting traffic. Developers now **build systems that learn and adapt** over time.

3. **Automation & Intelligence in Testing** 🧪🧠
   AI testing tools use historical data and real-time feedback to **predict flaky tests**, generate **test cases automatically**, and **analyze test coverage** efficiently.

4. **Natural Language Interfaces** 💬➡️💻
   Chat-based prompts (like OpenAI Codex or ChatGPT) are changing how we interact with code—**turning plain English into executable code**.

5. **AutoML & MLOps** ⚙️🔄
   From training models to deploying them, **AutoML platforms** (like Google AutoML or H2O.ai) and **MLOps tools** (like MLflow, Kubeflow) simplify model management.
