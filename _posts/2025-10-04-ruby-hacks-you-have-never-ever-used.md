# 💎 Ruby Hacks You’ve Never Ever Used (But Should!) 🚀

Ruby is already a beautiful language—simple, elegant, and developer-friendly. But beneath its simplicity, there are **hidden hacks and tricks** that even seasoned developers rarely touch. 🤫

In this blog, we’ll uncover **Ruby hacks you’ve probably never used before**—with clear **use cases, code examples, and pro tips**. Let’s make your Ruby coding smarter and cooler! 😎✨

## 1️⃣ `tap` – Debug & Chain Like a Pro 🔍

The `tap` method lets you "tap into" an object, run operations, and still return the object itself.

### Example: Debugging in the middle of a chain

```ruby
user = { name: "Raj", age: 27 }
  .tap { |u| puts "Before update: #{u}" }
  .merge(age: 28)
  .tap { |u| puts "After update: #{u}" }
```

👉 Output:

```
Before update: {:name=>"Raj", :age=>27}
After update: {:name=>"Raj", :age=>28}
```

💡 **Tip**: Use `tap` to peek into objects while chaining methods without breaking the flow. Perfect for debugging or logging!

---

## 2️⃣ `then` – Functional Style ✨

Introduced in Ruby 2.6, `then` works like `tap` but **returns the block result** instead of the object.

### Example: Chained transformations

```ruby
(5).then { |n| n * 2 }
    .then { |n| "Result is #{n}" }
# => "Result is 10"
```

💡 **Tip**: Combine `tap` and `then` wisely—`tap` for debugging, `then` for transformations.

---

## 3️⃣ `__send__` – Call Hidden Methods 🕵️

Sometimes method names clash with Ruby keywords or are private. Enter `__send__`.

### Example: Accessing a method that collides with keywords

```ruby
class Weird
  def class
    "I hacked Ruby 😅"
  end
end

obj = Weird.new
puts obj.__send__(:class)  # => "I hacked Ruby 😅"
```

💡 **Tip**: Use carefully—overusing `__send__` can lead to confusing code. Best for meta-programming cases.

---

## 4️⃣ `||=` – The Lazy Saver 💾

A shorthand way to **set a value only if it's not already set**.

### Example:

```ruby
name ||= "Guest"
# If name already has a value, it won’t be overwritten.
```

💡 **Tip**: Perfect for **memoization** in methods.

```ruby
def expensive_call
  @result ||= perform_heavy_task
end
```

---

## 5️⃣ `Hash#fetch` with Defaults 🔑

Using `hash[:key]` can give you `nil`. `fetch` makes you intentional.

### Example:

```ruby
user = { name: "Raj" }

puts user.fetch(:name, "Guest")  # => "Raj"
puts user.fetch(:age, 20)        # => 20
```

💡 **Tip**: Avoids `nil` errors and makes your code more **predictable**.

---

## 6️⃣ Safe Navigation Operator `&.` 🚦

No more `nil` checking nightmares.

### Example:

```ruby
user = nil
puts user&.name   # => nil (instead of crashing)
```

💡 **Tip**: Combine with chaining when dealing with APIs or optional objects.

---

## 7️⃣ `%w` and `%i` for Arrays & Symbols 🚀

A cleaner way to define arrays and symbols.

### Example:

```ruby
fruits = %w[apple banana mango]  
roles  = %i[admin editor viewer]  
```

💡 **Tip**: Cleaner, faster, and avoids unnecessary quotes or commas.

---

## 8️⃣ `Enumerator#lazy` – Infinite Magic ♾️

Process **infinite or large data** without blowing up memory.

### Example: Infinite sequence

```ruby
lazy_numbers = (1..Float::INFINITY).lazy.select { |n| n.even? }
puts lazy_numbers.first(5)  # => [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

💡 **Tip**: Use `lazy` for APIs or huge datasets when you don’t want to load everything into memory.

---

## 9️⃣ Flip-Flop Operator `..` and `...` ⚡

Yes, Ruby has a **flip-flop operator** often overlooked!

### Example: Within conditions

```ruby
(1..10).each do |i|
  puts i if (i == 3)..(i == 7)
end
# => 3,4,5,6,7
```

💡 **Tip**: Useful in parsing ranges or line-matching in files.

---

## 🔟 Monkey Patching with Refinements 🐒

Instead of globally monkey-patching, use **refinements** to limit scope.

### Example:

```ruby
module StringExtensions
  refine String do
    def shout
      upcase + "!!!"
    end
  end
end

using StringExtensions
puts "hello".shout   # => HELLO!!!
```

💡 **Tip**: Always prefer refinements over direct monkey-patching to keep your code safe.

# 🎯 Final Pro Tips

✨ Start small—try one hack in your next Ruby project.
✨ Use `tap` and `then` for cleaner pipelines.
✨ Use `lazy` for big datasets.
✨ Always keep readability first—hacks are fun, but clarity wins.

# 🚀 Conclusion

Ruby is like an iceberg—most developers only see the surface, but deep down, it has **powerful hacks** that make coding smarter and more enjoyable. 💎

Use these hacks wisely, and you’ll write **cleaner, faster, and more elegant Ruby code** than ever before! 🌟
