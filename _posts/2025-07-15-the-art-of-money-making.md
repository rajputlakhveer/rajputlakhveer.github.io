## 🎯 1. **Understand the Value of Time Over Money**

> *“Time is more valuable than money. You can get more money, but you cannot get more time.” – Jim Rohn*

### ✅ Principle:

Rich people trade **time for value**, not just money. They focus on scalable work (e.g., business, assets, content creation) over one-time effort.

### 🧠 Example:

A YouTuber making a video once and earning from it for years = **leveraging time**.

## 💡 2. **Make Money Work for You**

> *“If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.” – Warren Buffett*

### ✅ Principle:

Earn **passive income** through **investments**, **real estate**, **royalties**, or **automated businesses**.

### 🧠 Example:

Investing ₹10,000/month in mutual funds with 12% average return = ₹23 lakhs+ in 10 years. 📈

---

## 🏛️ 3. **Build Multiple Income Streams**

> *“Never depend on a single income. Make investment to create a second source.” – Warren Buffett*

Relying on one job is risky. Smart money-makers build 3–7 streams like:

* 💼 Job
* 📘 Digital Products (eBooks, Courses)
* 🏠 Rental Income
* 💹 Stocks
* 💻 Freelancing
* 📈 Business

## 📘 4. **Master Financial Literacy**

> *“Formal education will make you a living; self-education will make you a fortune.” – Jim Rohn*

Learn how money works—**taxes, compounding, inflation, debt, investing**.

### 🧠 Example:

Knowing how compound interest works can turn ₹1 lakh into ₹10 lakhs with the right patience and plan.

## 💪 5. **Earn More, Save Smart, Invest Wisely**

> *“Do not save what is left after spending; spend what is left after saving.” – Warren Buffett*

### ✅ Principle:

Budget wisely. Follow the **50/30/20 Rule**:

* 50% Needs
* 30% Wants
* 20% Investments

And increase income every year. Avoid lifestyle inflation. ⛔

---

## 💼 6. **Start Early, Think Long-Term**

> *“The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is now.” – Chinese Proverb*

### ✅ Principle:

The earlier you start investing or building a business, the better your results due to **compound growth**.

---

## 🚀 7. **Take Calculated Risks**

> *“The biggest risk is not taking any risk.” – Mark Zuckerberg*

### ✅ Principle:

Starting a business, investing, or switching careers needs courage. But take **informed, calculated risks**.

---

## 📊 8. **Track Every Rupee**

### ✅ Principle:

Wealthy people **track income, expenses, and ROI**. Use apps like:
