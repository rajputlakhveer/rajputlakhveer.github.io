## 🔑 **What is Active Support?**

Active Support is a core component of Ruby on Rails that extends the Ruby language with additional methods, classes, and modules. It’s designed to make your code more expressive, concise, and readable. Whether you’re working with strings, arrays, dates, or even your own custom classes, Active Support has something for everyone.

---

## 🛠️ **Key Utilities of Active Support**

Let’s break down the most useful utilities in Active Support with examples:

---

### 1. **Core Extensions** ✨

Active Support enhances Ruby’s core classes with additional methods. Here are some highlights:

#### **String Extensions**
```ruby
# Convert a string to a URL-friendly format
"Active Support Rocks!".parameterize # => "active-support-rocks"

# Check if a string is blank (empty or only whitespace)
"".blank? # => true
"Hello".blank? # => false
```

#### **Array Extensions**
```ruby
# Convert an array to a sentence
["Ruby", "Rails", "Active Support"].to_sentence # => "Ruby, Rails, and Active Support"

# Extract a specific element from an array
[1, 2, 3, 4].second # => 2
```

#### **Hash Extensions**
```ruby
# Deep merge two hashes
hash1 = { a: { b: 1 } }
hash2 = { a: { c: 2 } }
hash1.deep_merge(hash2) # => { a: { b: 1, c: 2 } }

# Convert hash keys to symbols
{ "name" => "John", "age" => 30 }.symbolize_keys # => { name: "John", age: 30 }
```

---

### 2. **Time and Date Helpers** ⏰

Active Support makes working with dates and times a breeze.

```ruby
# Calculate time relative to now
1.day.ago # => 2023-10-20 12:00:00 UTC
3.hours.from_now # => 2023-10-21 15:00:00 UTC

# Convert time to a human-readable format
Time.now.to_formatted_s(:long) # => "October 21, 2023 12:00"
```

---

### 3. **Inflections** 📏

Inflections help you manipulate strings for pluralization, singularization, and more.

```ruby
# Pluralize a word
"person".pluralize # => "people"

# Singularize a word
"users".singularize # => "user"

# Convert a string to a class name
"user_profile".camelize # => "UserProfile"
```

---

### 4. **Callbacks** 📞

Callbacks allow you to hook into the lifecycle of an object.

```ruby
class User
  include ActiveSupport::Callbacks

  define_callbacks :save

  def save
    run_callbacks :save do
      puts "User saved!"
    end
  end
end

user = User.new
user.save # => "User saved!"
```

---

### 5. **Concern** 🧩

Concern is a module that helps you organize and reuse code in a clean and modular way.

```ruby
module Loggable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    def log(message)
      puts "Log: #{message}"
    end
  end
end

class User
  include Loggable
end

user = User.new
user.log("User created!") # => "Log: User created!"
```

---

### 6. **Caching** 💾

Active Support provides a simple and powerful caching mechanism.

```ruby
# Cache a value
Rails.cache.write("greeting", "Hello, World!")

# Fetch a cached value
Rails.cache.read("greeting") # => "Hello, World!"
```

---

### 7. **Testing Helpers** 🧪

Active Support includes utilities to make testing easier.

```ruby
# Test if two objects are the same
assert_same expected, actual

# Test if a block raises an exception
assert_raises(StandardError) { raise "Error!" }
```

---

### 8. **Internationalization (I18n)** 🌍

Active Support simplifies working with multiple languages.

```ruby
# Translate a string
I18n.t("hello") # => "Hello"

# Set the locale
I18n.locale = :es
I18n.t("hello") # => "Hola"
```

---

### 9. **Notifications** 🔔

Notifications allow you to instrument your code for monitoring and debugging.

```ruby
ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe("render") do |*args|
  event = ActiveSupport::Notifications::Event.new(*args)
  puts "Rendered in #{event.duration}ms"
end

ActiveSupport::Notifications.instrument("render", extra: :info) do
  sleep(1) # Simulate rendering
end
```

---

### 10. **Dependencies** 🔗

Active Support’s dependency system helps manage autoloading and reloading of classes.

```ruby
# Autoload a class
ActiveSupport::Dependencies.autoload_paths << "app/models"

# Reload all classes
ActiveSupport::Dependencies.clear
```

---
