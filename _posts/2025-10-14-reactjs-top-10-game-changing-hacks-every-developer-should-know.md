*Supercharge Your React Skills with These Hidden Gems 🔥*

ReactJS has completely transformed the front-end development landscape — giving developers the power to build lightning-fast, dynamic, and modular web applications. ⚛️ But even with all its brilliance, there are tons of **hidden hacks** and **smart patterns** that can make your React code *cleaner, faster,* and *more scalable*.

Let’s explore the **Top 10 Game-Changing ReactJS Hacks** that will make you code like a pro 💻👇

### ⚡ 1. Use Memoization to Avoid Unnecessary Re-renders

**The Problem:**
When a parent component re-renders, all its child components re-render too — even if their props didn’t change! 😩

**The Hack:**
Use `React.memo` and `useMemo` to prevent wasteful re-renders.

```jsx
import React, { useMemo } from "react";

const ExpensiveComponent = ({ num }) => {
  const computedValue = useMemo(() => {
    console.log("Calculating...");
    return num * 2;
  }, [num]);

  return <p>Computed Value: {computedValue}</p>;
};

export default React.memo(ExpensiveComponent);
```

✅ **Pro Tip:** Always wrap functional components with `React.memo` if they render the same output for the same props.

---

### 🧠 2. Custom Hooks — Write Once, Use Everywhere

Custom hooks are a *superpower* in React that help extract and reuse logic easily.

**Example – useFetch Hook:**

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const useFetch = (url) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(url)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(json => {
        setData(json);
        setLoading(false);
      });
  }, [url]);

  return { data, loading };
};

export default useFetch;
```

Usage:

```jsx
const { data, loading } = useFetch("https://api.example.com/users");
```

✅ **Good Practice:** Always prefix your custom hooks with `use` and keep them in a separate folder like `/hooks`.

---

### 🧩 3. Lazy Loading Components for Performance Boost

Why load everything at once when you can load on demand? 🎯

```jsx
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from "react";

const UserProfile = lazy(() => import("./UserProfile"));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <UserProfile />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

✅ **Good Practice:** Split large apps into smaller chunks to improve initial load time.

---

### 🪄 4. Use Context API Instead of Prop Drilling

Stop passing props through multiple levels of components. 🛑

```jsx
const UserContext = React.createContext();

const App = () => (
  <UserContext.Provider value={{ name: "Lakhveer" }}>
    <Profile />
  </UserContext.Provider>
);

const Profile = () => {
  const user = React.useContext(UserContext);
  return <h2>Hello, {user.name} 👋</h2>;
};
```

✅ **Pro Tip:** Use context for global states like themes, user data, or localization.

---

### 🎯 5. Destructure Props Like a Pro

It’s simple but powerful — makes your code clean and readable.

```jsx
// Instead of this:
const User = (props) => <h2>{props.name}</h2>;

// Do this:
const User = ({ name }) => <h2>{name}</h2>;
```

✅ **Good Practice:** Always destructure props and state objects at the top of your component.

---

### 💥 6. Conditional Rendering Shortcuts

Make your UI cleaner and more intuitive with logical operators.

```jsx
{isLoggedIn && <Dashboard />}
{!isLoggedIn ? <Login /> : <Logout />}
```

✅ **Pro Tip:** Use short-circuit rendering for small conditional UIs instead of verbose if-else statements.

---

### ⚙️ 7. Optimize Lists with Keys and Fragments

Always use **unique keys** when rendering lists. And use **fragments** to avoid unnecessary DOM nodes.

```jsx
<>
  {users.map(user => (
    <p key={user.id}>{user.name}</p>
  ))}
</>
```

✅ **Good Practice:** Never use array indexes as keys — it can cause performance and state bugs.

---

### 🧱 8. Error Boundaries for Safe Components

React can crash due to runtime errors — but you can prevent that using **Error Boundaries** 🛡️

```jsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  state = { hasError: false };

  static getDerivedStateFromError() {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  render() {
    return this.state.hasError ? <h2>Something went wrong 😢</h2> : this.props.children;
  }
}
```

Usage:

```jsx
<ErrorBoundary>
  <MyComponent />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

✅ **Pro Tip:** Wrap risky components like charts, 3rd-party libraries, or animations.

---

### 🧭 9. Debounce Search Inputs

Avoid firing multiple API calls while typing in input boxes!

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function useDebounce(value, delay) {
  const [debounced, setDebounced] = useState(value);

  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => setDebounced(value), delay);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }, [value, delay]);

  return debounced;
}
```

✅ **Good Practice:** Use debounce for real-time search or auto-suggestions to reduce API load.

---

### 💡 10. Use TypeScript for Safer React Apps

TypeScript + React = 💕
It prevents runtime bugs and improves developer confidence.

```tsx
type UserProps = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

const User = ({ name, age }: UserProps) => <h2>{name} is {age} years old</h2>;
```

✅ **Good Practice:** Use TypeScript interfaces or types for props and state, especially in large projects.
