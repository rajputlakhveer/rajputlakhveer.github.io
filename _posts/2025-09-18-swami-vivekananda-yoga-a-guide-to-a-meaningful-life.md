## 🕉️ 1️⃣ **Karma Yoga – The Path of Selfless Action**

**Key Idea:** *“Work, but do not care for the result.”*

✨ **Characteristics of Karma Yoga:**

* Work as a form of worship 🙏
* No attachment to outcomes
* Service to others is service to God
* Purification of the heart through action

📖 **Story:**
When Swami Vivekananda traveled to America for the Parliament of Religions (1893), he faced countless challenges—financial struggles, cultural barriers, and rejection. Yet, he never gave up. His dedication to spreading Vedanta philosophy without personal gain reflected the essence of Karma Yoga.

Jnana Yoga focuses on **intellect and wisdom**, urging us to question, reflect, and realize the truth of existence. It is about discovering the difference between the **eternal Self (Atman)** and the temporary world.

✨ **Characteristics of Jnana Yoga:**

* Deep inquiry and self-reflection 🤔
* Discrimination between real (permanent) and unreal (temporary)
* Meditation on the nature of the Self
* Freedom from ego and ignorance

📖 **Story:**

* Spend 10–20 minutes daily in self-inquiry (“Who am I?”) 🕯️
* Read spiritual texts like the *Bhagavad Gita* or *Upanishads* 📚
* Question your attachments and desires

## 💖 3️⃣ **Bhakti Yoga – The Path of Devotion**

**Key Idea:** *“Love for God is the highest love.”*

* Surrender to a higher power 💞
* Prayer, chanting, and singing hymns 🎶
* Seeing God in everyone and everything
* Cultivating unconditional love

* Start your day with a prayer or mantra 🕉️
* Listen to bhajans or spiritual music

## 🧘 4️⃣ **Raja Yoga – The Path of Meditation & Mind Mastery**

**Key Idea:** *“Control the mind, and you control the universe.”*

Raja Yoga is the science of **meditation and self-discipline**, designed to bring mental clarity and spiritual awakening. It follows the eightfold path described by Patanjali, including ethics, posture, breathing, concentration, and ultimate absorption (Samadhi).

✨ **Characteristics of Raja Yoga:**

* Focused meditation 🧘
* Mind control and inner stillness
* Breathing exercises (Pranayama) 🌬️
* Path to ultimate spiritual realization

* Practice breathing exercises to calm the mind
* Follow a disciplined routine with healthy habits
* Limit distractions and embrace silence

## ✨ The Vedanta Philosophy 🌏

At the heart of Vivekananda’s teachings was **Vedanta**, the philosophy that declares:

> **“Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this divinity by controlling nature, external and internal.”**

Vedanta teaches that **God is within us**, and our purpose is to realize this inner divinity through selfless work, devotion, meditation, and knowledge—the four yogas combined.

Key Insights of Vedanta:

* All religions lead to the same truth 🌈
* The universe is one interconnected whole
* True freedom is freedom from ego and ignorance
* Serve humanity as service to God

Swami Vivekananda encouraged a **balanced life**, blending all four yogas:

* **Work like a Karma Yogi**: Serve without expectation.
* **Think like a Jnana Yogi**: Question and seek truth.
* **Love like a Bhakti Yogi**: Devote yourself to the Divine.
* **Meditate like a Raja Yogi**: Calm and master your mind.

> 💬 *“Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached.”* – Swami Vivekananda
