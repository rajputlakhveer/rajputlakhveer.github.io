# üìä **Graphs Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples & Problems!** üöÄ  

Graphs are one of the most versatile and powerful data structures in computer science. They model relationships between objects, making them essential for solving problems in social networks, maps, recommendation systems, and more. In this blog, we‚Äôll dive deep into **graphs**, their types, representations, and real-world problem-solving with code examples! üéØ

## **üîπ What is a Graph?**  
A **graph** is a non-linear data structure consisting of:  
- **Vertices (Nodes)**: Represent entities (e.g., users in a social network).  
- **Edges**: Represent relationships between nodes (e.g., friendships).  

Formally, a graph **G = (V, E)**, where:  
- **V** = Set of vertices  
- **E** = Set of edges  

---

## **üîπ Types of Graphs**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Undirected Graph**  
- Edges have **no direction**.  
- If (A, B) is an edge, then A is connected to B and vice versa.  
- **Example**: Facebook friendships (if A is friends with B, then B is also friends with A).  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Directed Graph (Digraph)**  
- Edges have **direction**.  
- (A ‚Üí B) means A points to B, but not necessarily the reverse.  
- **Example**: Twitter followings (A follows B doesn‚Äôt mean B follows A).  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Weighted Graph**  
- Edges have **weights (costs)** associated with them.  
- **Example**: Road networks (weights represent distances).  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Unweighted Graph**  
- Edges have **no weights**.  
- **Example**: Social network connections.  

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Cyclic Graph**  
- Contains **at least one cycle** (a path that starts and ends at the same node).  
- **Example**: Circular dependencies in tasks.  

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Acyclic Graph**  
- **No cycles** present.  
- **Example**: Family tree (no one can be their own ancestor).  

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Connected Graph**  
- **All nodes are reachable** from any other node.  
- **Example**: Fully linked computer network.  

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Disconnected Graph**  
- Some nodes are **unreachable** from others.  
- **Example**: Isolated computers in a network.  

### **9Ô∏è‚É£ Tree**  
- A **connected acyclic undirected graph**.  
- **Example**: File system hierarchy.  

### **üîü Bipartite Graph**  
- Vertices can be divided into **two disjoint sets** where no two graph vertices in the same set are adjacent.  
- **Example**: Job applicants (set A) and job positions (set B).

## **üîπ Graph Representations**  
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Adjacency Matrix**  
- A **2D array** where `matrix[i][j] = 1` if there‚Äôs an edge between `i` and `j`, else `0`.  
- **Pros**:  
  - Fast edge lookup (O(1)).  
- **Cons**:  
  - Consumes more space (O(V¬≤)).  

#### **Example Code (Undirected Graph):**  
```python
# Adjacency Matrix for an undirected graph
V = 4
graph = [[0] * V for _ in range(V)]

def add_edge(u, v):
    graph[u][v] = 1
    graph[v][u] = 1  # Since it's undirected

add_edge(0, 1)
add_edge(1, 2)
add_edge(2, 3)
add_edge(3, 0)

print(graph)
```
**Output:**  
```
[
 [0, 1, 0, 1],
 [1, 0, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 0, 1],
 [1, 0, 1, 0]
]
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Adjacency List**  
- A **list of lists** where each node stores its neighbors.  
- **Pros**:  
  - Space-efficient (O(V + E)).  
- **Cons**:  
  - Slower edge lookup (O(V) in worst case).  

#### **Example Code (Directed Graph):**  
```python
# Adjacency List for a directed graph
graph = {
    0: [1, 2],
    1: [2],
    2: [0, 3],
    3: [3]
}

print(graph)
```
**Output:**  
```
{0: [1, 2], 1: [2], 2: [0, 3], 3: [3]}
```

## **üîπ Graph Traversals**  
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
- Explores **level by level** (uses a **queue**).  
- **Use Case**: Shortest path in an unweighted graph.  

#### **Example Code:**  
```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])
    visited.add(start)
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        print(node, end=" ")
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)

# Example usage
graph = {0: [1, 2], 1: [2], 2: [0, 3], 3: [3]}
bfs(graph, 2)
```
**Output:**  
```
2 0 3 1
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Depth-First Search (DFS)**  
- Explores as **deep as possible** (uses a **stack**).  
- **Use Case**: Topological sorting, cycle detection.  

#### **Example Code (Recursive):**  
```python
def dfs(graph, node, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    visited.add(node)
    print(node, end=" ")
    
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)

# Example usage
graph = {0: [1, 2], 1: [2], 2: [0, 3], 3: [3]}
dfs(graph, 2)
```
**Output:**  
```
2 0 1 3
```

## **üîπ Common Graph Problems & Solutions**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Shortest Path (Unweighted Graph) ‚Äì BFS**  
**Problem:** Find the shortest path from **A to B** in an unweighted graph.  

#### **Solution:**  
```python
from collections import deque

def shortest_path_bfs(graph, start, end):
    queue = deque([(start, [start])])
    visited = set([start])
    
    while queue:
        node, path = queue.popleft()
        if node == end:
            return path
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))
    return None

# Example usage
graph = {0: [1, 3], 1: [0, 2], 2: [1, 3], 3: [0, 2]}
print(shortest_path_bfs(graph, 0, 2))
```
**Output:**  
```
[0, 1, 2]  # Shortest path from 0 ‚Üí 2
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Detect Cycle in a Directed Graph ‚Äì DFS**  
**Problem:** Check if a **directed graph** contains a cycle.  

#### **Solution:**  
```python
def is_cyclic_directed(graph):
    visited = set()
    recursion_stack = set()
    
    def dfs(node):
        visited.add(node)
        recursion_stack.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                if dfs(neighbor):
                    return True
            elif neighbor in recursion_stack:
                return True
        recursion_stack.remove(node)
        return False
    
    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            if dfs(node):
                return True
    return False

# Example usage
graph = {0: [1], 1: [2], 2: [0]}
print(is_cyclic_directed(graph))  # Output: True
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Topological Sorting (DAG) ‚Äì DFS**  
**Problem:** Linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge **u ‚Üí v**, **u comes before v**.  

#### **Solution:**  
```python
def topological_sort(graph):
    visited = set()
    stack = []
    
    def dfs(node):
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(neighbor)
        stack.append(node)
    
    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            dfs(node)
    return stack[::-1]

# Example usage
graph = {5: [2, 0], 4: [0, 1], 2: [3], 3: [1]}
print(topological_sort(graph))
```
**Output:**  
```
[5, 4, 2, 3, 1, 0]  # Valid topological order
```
