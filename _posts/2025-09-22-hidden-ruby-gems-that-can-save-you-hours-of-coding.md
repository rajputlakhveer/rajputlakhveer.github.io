## 1️⃣ **Pry** – Your Supercharged IRB 💡

### 🔥 What it does:

`pry` is an alternative to the default IRB console, giving you **powerful debugging, runtime navigation, and live REPL features**.

### ⭐ Key Features:

* 💬 **Better Console Experience** – Syntax highlighting, command history.
* 🧭 **Step Inside Your Code** – Use `binding.pry` to pause execution and inspect variables in real-time.
* 🔄 **Code Reloading** – Reload methods without restarting the console.

### 💻 Example:

```ruby
require 'pry'

def calculate_tax(amount)
  binding.pry   # Execution stops here!
  amount * 0.18
end

puts calculate_tax(100)
```

When the code hits `binding.pry`, you drop into an interactive console, allowing you to inspect `amount`, change values, and even redefine methods on the fly. 🚀

## 2️⃣ **Awesome Print** – Beautiful Object Printing 🎨

### 🔥 What it does:

`awesome_print` makes console outputs **colorful and beautifully formatted**, so you can debug with clarity.

### ⭐ Key Features:

* 🌈 **Pretty Print** Hashes, Arrays, and JSON with colors.
* 🪄 Works seamlessly with Rails console using `ap` method.

### 💻 Example:

```ruby
require 'awesome_print'

data = { name: "Lakhveer", skills: ["Ruby", "React"], level: "Pro" }
ap data
```

Instead of a messy hash, you get a clean, colorful output making debugging *fun* and easy. 🎯
