![cover](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66e28f29-503f-4729-954b-9edc07e26884)

### **1. Solid Cache: Database-Powered Caching by Default 🗃️⚡**  
Rails 8 replaces traditional cache stores with **Solid Cache**, leveraging your PostgreSQL or MySQL database for seamless, scalable caching. No more Redis setup headaches!  

**Deep Dive:**  
- Uses database tables for cache entries.  
- Supports automatic pruning and compression.  
- Ideal for multi-server environments.  

**Setup:**  
```ruby  
# config/environments/production.rb  
config.cache_store = :solid_cache, compression: true, expires_in: 12.hours  
```  

**Usage:**  
```ruby  
# Cache fragments with metadata  
Rails.cache.write("trending_posts", Post.trending, version: 2, tags: ["posts"])  
```  

---

### **2. ActiveRecord Async Queries: Non-Blocking DB Magic ⏳🔍**  
Run database queries in the background without blocking your app’s responsiveness.  

**Example:**  
```ruby  
# Start async query  
async_posts = Post.where(published: true).order(created_at: :desc).async  
# Fetch results later (lazy-loaded)  
posts = async_posts.load  
```  
**Bonus:** Chain async with `to_a`, `first`, or `count` for dynamic workflows!  

---

### **3. Built-In Multi-Endpoint Health Checks 🩺📡**  
Rails 8 introduces **customizable health endpoints** for databases, cache, and third-party services.  

**Configure in Routes:**  
```ruby  
# config/routes.rb  
Rails.application.routes.health_check  
```  
**Endpoints:**  
- `/up` → App status  
- `/up/db` → Database connectivity  
- `/up/cache` → Cache status  

**Response:**  
```json  
{ "status": "ok", "details": { "db": { "connected": true } } }  
```  

---

### **4. Bun as Default JavaScript Runtime 📦🐇**  
Swap Node.js for **Bun**—a lightning-fast JavaScript runtime. Enjoy instant `importmap` updates and 10x faster builds!  

**Setup:**  
```bash  
bun install  
rails javascript:install:bun  
```  
**Benefits:**  
- Bun’s built-in bundler and test runner.  
- Seamless `esbuild` integration.  

---

### **5. Advanced Security: Automatic CSP & Encrypted Cookies 🛡️🔐**  
Rails 8 auto-generates **Content Security Policies (CSP)** and encrypts cookies by default.  

**Customize CSP:**  
```ruby  
# config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb  
policy.script_src :self, :https, "https://cdn.example.com"  
policy.style_src :self, :unsafe_inline # For Tailwind  
```  

**Encrypt Cookies:**  
```ruby  
config.action_dispatch.encrypted_cookie_salt = "your-secure-salt"  
```  

---

### **6. Parallel Testing for Blazing-Fast Suites 🧪⚡**  
Run tests in parallel across CPU cores **out of the box**!  

**Enable in `test_helper.rb`:**  
```ruby  
class ActiveSupport::TestCase  
  parallelize(workers: :number_of_processors)  
end  
```  
**Bonus:** Use `parallelize_setup` to seed data per worker.  

---

### **7. Active Record Encryption for Sensitive Data 🔒📝**  
Encrypt specific database fields **declaratively**.  

**Example:**  
```ruby  
class User < ApplicationRecord  
  encrypts :ssn, :email, deterministic: true # For querying  
end  
```  
**Key Management:**  
- Uses `Rails.application.credentials.active_record_encryption`.  

---

### **8. Database Sharding Made Easy 🗄️🌐**  
Built-in support for horizontal database sharding.  

**Define Shards:**  
```ruby  
# config/database.yml  
production:  
  primary:  
    database: primary_db  
  primary_shard_one:  
    database: shard_one  
    migrations_paths: db/shard_one_migrate  
```  

**Switch Shards Dynamically:**  
```ruby  
ActiveRecord::Base.connected_to(shard: :shard_one) do  
  User.create!(name: "Sharded User")  
end  
```  

---

### **Bonus Goodies 🎁✨**  
- **Zeitwerk 3.0:** Faster reloading and `zeitwerk:check` for debugging.  
- **Template Error Annotations:** Spot typos in views with inline hints.  
- **CLI Generators for Hotwire:** `rails generate turbo_frame` for instant UI components.
